# QA technical test - Front


## **Aircall context…**

### You work at Aircall….

The feature team is releasing a new version of our application which is a phone that you can use within a browser (only google chrome). 
We created an account for you with a number associated that you can use to receive and make calls. 
All basic functionalities are available and working and we want to ensure that they are not broken. 


### Goals…
1. Read a test plan and to automate what you think is relevant
2. Be accurate. Explain your choices (test plan, tools etc…). <br/> 
Keep in mind that we are interested in technical skills as much as logic and mindset.

### Tools…
Free, use the tools you want

### Go beyond…
Add any relevant contribution you feel is important. As a QA Team, we own testing!

### Your feedback…Send us:
* Your test plan
* Your automated test
* A readme file explaining how to run it (a video works as well)

### Test details…
* Test plan -> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cxOlQ8mVeqdff4tvgJPLwyUxf26Z_jwH5YaFs15gu68/edit#gid=0
